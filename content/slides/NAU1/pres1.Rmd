## Puzzle

.bullet-content[
- In Behavioural Economics there is a WTP-WTA gap attributed to bias.
- In Financial Market Modeling there is the bid-ask spread attributed to a rational response to asymmetric information.

## Information not Important
.bullet-content[
\begin{align*}
 WTP(x) &= \mathbb{E}(x) \\
 WTA(x) &= \mathbb{E}(x) \\
 WTP(x) &= WTA(x)
\end{align*}
]

--

## Information Important
.bullet-content[
\begin{align*}
 WTP(x) &= \mathbb{E}(x|\textrm{ someone wants to sell }x) \\
 WTA(x) &= \mathbb{E}(x|\textrm{ someone wants to buy }x) \\
 WTP(x) &\leq WTA(x)
\end{align*}

## Claim

.bullet-content[
if..
1. Agents do not know the value of $x$.
2. Agents values of $x$ are correlated

then  
$$ WTP(x) < WTA(x) $$
]

## Agents do not know the value of x.

.bullet-content[
- The easy case:
    - Goods with Resale value
    - New Unknown Goods (books, films)
- But also consider the mug:
    - I am not a mug expert
    - I want to own mugs other people find attractive
    - I cannot perfectly predict how I will feel about the mug in the future
    - I do not know what else is available
    - To know the dollar value of a mug is to know the EU of the mug and the EU of a dollar
    - If there is any information that could cause me to change my valuation, then there is uncertainty

$i \in \{B, S\}$, one Buyer and one Seller.  
Strategies:  
$s_S = WTA \in \mathbb{R}$

**ORDER**

1. Nature chooses $v_i$ and $s_i$ 
2. $i$ observes $s_i$   
3. Buyer chooses WTP, Seller chooses WTA  
4. Nature chooses $p$ randomly (BDM), transaction if $WTA < p < WTP$

## Predictions

.bullet-content[

- $GAP_i(\sigma_i, \sigma_d)$ is increasing in $\sigma_i$ and decreasing in $\sigma_d$
- The greater the uncertainty of value, the greater the gap
- The greater the similarity, the greater the gap

## Info Based Approach Explains

.bullet-content[
- Experienced traders do not have Endowment Effect (List, 2003)
- Smaller Endowment Effect when items are similar (Chapman, 1998)
- Bigger WTP-WTA gaps for non-market goods (TunÃ§el & Hammitt, 2014)
- Endowment Effect sometimes vanishes (Plott & Zeiler, 2007)

## Experiment 1: The Model Itself

.bullet-content[
- Explain RV drawn from distribution (or with balls from urns).  
- Elicit WTP/WTA  
- Vary (dis)similarity
- Vary uncertainty
- Could be unnatural?
]
 
---

## Experiment 2: Vernon Smith Style

.bullet-content[
- Elicit WTA/WTP for lotteries for tokens.  
- Vary the (dis)similarity via
  - tokens worth different amounts for different participants.
]

---

## Experiment 3: Lotteries for Money

.bullet-content[
- Elicit WTA/WTP for lotteries.  
- Vary 'uncertainty' via 
  1. Complexity of lotteries
  2. Number of practice draws
  3. Decision time  
  4. Maths test score
- Vary (dis)similarity via 
  1. Risk aversion score visible to both $i$ and $j$

  
]

---

## Experiment 4: Goods

.bullet-content[
- Elicit WTP/WTA for goods
- Vary 'uncertainty' via:
  1. Decision time 
  2. Giving more information about the goods
  3. Ask questions that force participants to think about value
- Vary (dis)similarity via
  1. with Genderised vs non-genderised goods + reveal gender?
  2. goods with high variation i.e. some people use them a lot, other people rarely.
  e.g. shoes + Shoe size?

## Experiment 5: Teams

.bullet-content[
- Elicit WTP/WTA for goods or lotteries
- Decisions made  alone vs in teams of two (with chat)
- They must agree, but then each receive or pay full p
- Could increase effort or model as two independent signals
- Teams should have smaller gaps than individuals.
]

---

## Experiment 6: Exchange with whom?

.bullet-content[
- Elicit WTP/WTA for goods.
- Vary dis(similarity):  
  - exchange with experimenter vs  
  - exchange with fellow student vs
  - exchange with fellow student who already owns a lot of said good
- repeat with different goods, swapping buying and selling roles, one being chosen at the end
]

---

## Experiment 7: Similar Goods

.bullet-content[
- Ask willing to Exchange
- Vary 'uncertainty' via:
 - changing the goods: (similar goods, smaller gap)
- Already done (Chapman, 1998)
]

---

## Experiment 8: Extra Info

.bullet-content[
- Ask willing to Exchange 
- Give info: either  
  1. Another person was not willing to exchange, vs
  2. Another person was willing to exchange
- Could be unnatural?  
]

---

## Experiment 9: Find an Object

.bullet-content[
- Ask willing to Exchange 
- Frame with a story: either  
  1. You meet another individual, would you trade with them?
  2. You find object, but you only have space for one in your bag
- Could seem artificial?
